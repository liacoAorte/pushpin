If you are using Omnisphere, a popular software synthesizer from Spectrasonics, you might encounter an error message that says "Cannot load soundsource because directory core library not found". This error usually occurs when you try to load a patch or a soundsource from the core library of Omnisphere, which contains thousands of sounds and samples. The error means that Omnisphere cannot find the soundsource file or the index file that tells it where to look for the soundsource file.
  
This error can be frustrating and prevent you from using Omnisphere properly. Fortunately, there are some possible solutions that you can try to fix this error and enjoy Omnisphere again. In this article, we will show you how to fix "cannot load soundsource because directory core library not found" error in Omnisphere by following these steps:

1. Refresh the soundsource browser
2. Delete the zmap.index file
3. Reinstall the soundset or the STEAM folder
4. Contact Spectrasonics support

## 1. Refresh the soundsource browser
  
The first thing you should try to fix this error is to refresh the soundsource browser in Omnisphere. The soundsource browser is where you can browse and select different soundsources for your patches. Sometimes, the soundsource browser might not be updated or synchronized with the actual files in your STEAM folder, which is where Omnisphere stores all its soundsources and patches.
  
To refresh the soundsource browser, follow these steps:

- Open Omnisphere in your DAW or as a standalone application.
- Click on the "Soundsource" button at the top left corner of the interface.
- Click on the circular arrow icon at the bottom left corner of the soundsource browser window. This will refresh the soundsource browser and update the index file.
- Try loading a patch or a soundsource from the core library again and see if the error is gone.

## 2. Delete the zmap.index file
  
If refreshing the soundsource browser does not fix the error, you might need to delete the zmap.index file from your STEAM folder. The zmap.index file is a file that contains information about all the soundsources in your STEAM folder. Sometimes, this file might get corrupted or outdated and cause Omnisphere to not find the soundsource files correctly.
  
To delete the zmap.index file, follow these steps:

- Close Omnisphere and your DAW if they are running.
- Navigate to your STEAM folder on your computer. The default location is C:\ProgramData\Spectrasonics\STEAM.
- Go to Omnisphere\Soundsources\Factory\Core Library folder.
- Find and delete the zmap.index file. This file might be hidden, so make sure you enable hidden files and folders in your file explorer settings.
- Open Omnisphere again and try loading a patch or a soundsource from the core library again. Omnisphere will recreate the zmap.index file automatically and update it with the correct information.

## 3. Reinstall the soundset or the STEAM folder
  
If deleting the zmap.index file does not fix the error, you might need to reinstall the soundset or the entire STEAM folder. This error can sometimes happen if you have installed a third-party soundset for Omnisphere that is not compatible or has missing files. It can also happen if your STEAM folder has been moved, renamed, or corrupted.
  
To reinstall the soundset or the STEAM folder, follow these steps:

- Close Omnisphere and your DAW if they are running.
- If you have installed a third-party soundset for Omnisphere, uninstall it by deleting its folder from your STEAM folder.
- If you have not installed any third-party soundset for Omnisphere,
