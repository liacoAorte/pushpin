# Estratigrafia: A Comprehensive Textbook on Stratigraphy by Inmaculada Corrales and Others
 
Estratigrafia is a textbook on stratigraphy, the branch of geology that studies the arrangement and succession of rock layers. It was written by five Spanish professors of stratigraphy and historical geology: Inmaculada Corrales Zarauza, Juan Rosell Sanuy, Luis M. Sanchez de la Torre, Juan Antonio Vera Torres, and Lorenzo Vilas Minondo. The book was published by Editorial Rueda in 1983 and has 732 pages.
 
The book covers the concepts, methods, and objectives of stratigraphy, as well as its applications to various fields of geology. It provides a coherent and complete body of doctrine that is based on the observation of reality and the specific geology of Spain. The book includes numerous examples taken from the Spanish geology that allow the verification of the theoretical formulations in the field. The book also discusses the historical development of stratigraphy and its relations with other disciplines.

Stratigraphy is a fundamental discipline for understanding the history of the Earth and its life forms. It helps to reconstruct the past environments, climates, and events that shaped the planet and its biosphere. It also helps to locate and exploit natural resources, such as fossil fuels, minerals, and groundwater. Stratigraphy is based on the principle of superposition, which states that in an undisturbed sequence of rock layers, the oldest ones are at the bottom and the youngest ones are at the top.

Estratigrafia covers the main types of stratigraphy: lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, chronostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, chemostratigraphy, and sequence stratigraphy. It explains how to define and correlate stratigraphic units, such as formations, members, beds, zones, stages, epochs, and systems. It also describes how to use stratigraphic tools, such as fossils, isotopes, magnetic polarity, and cyclicity. It illustrates how to apply stratigraphic methods to different geological settings, such as sedimentary basins, orogenic belts, volcanic regions, and metamorphic terrains.
 
Estratigrafia is a comprehensive and updated textbook that reflects the current state of knowledge and research in stratigraphy. It is based on the authors' extensive experience in teaching and practicing stratigraphy in Spain and abroad. It is also enriched by the contributions of other experts who collaborated in some chapters. The book is well organized and clearly written, with numerous figures, tables, maps, diagrams, and photographs. It also includes exercises, references, glossaries, and indexes.
