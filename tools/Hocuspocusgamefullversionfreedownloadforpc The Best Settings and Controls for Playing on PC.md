In order to achieve his goals, Hocus has to complete 36 levels of action and puzzles, collecting magic crystals and defeating various enemies along the way. He can use his basic magic spell to shoot at foes, but he can also find potions that give him temporary power-ups, such as rapid fire, laser shots, high jump, teleportation and more.

If you want to get the most out of Hocus Pocus, you might want to learn some tips and tricks that can help you beat the game. Here are some of them:
 
- Save your potions for when you really need them. Potions are rare and powerful items that can give you an edge in combat or help you reach hidden areas. Don't waste them on easy enemies or unnecessary jumps.
- Explore every level thoroughly. There are many secrets and bonuses hidden in each level, such as extra lives, points, health, and even secret levels. Look for cracks in the walls, hidden passages, and switches that can open new paths.
- Use your map. The game provides you with a map that shows your current location and the location of the exit. You can access it by pressing F1. Use it to plan your route and avoid getting lost.
- Watch out for the spell cards. The Sanderson sisters will occasionally cast spells that affect the gameplay, such as reversing your controls, making enemies invisible, or speeding up time. You can see what spell is active by looking at the top left corner of the screen. Try to adapt to the spell effects or wait for them to wear off.
- Have fun! Hocus Pocus is a game that doesn't take itself too seriously. It has a lot of humor and references to other games and movies. Enjoy the jokes, the graphics, and the music, and don't get frustrated if you die or get stuck.

Hocus Pocus is a game that deserves a second chance. It may not be the most original or innovative platformer game ever made, but it is a fun and charming one that will keep you entertained for hours. You can download it now and relive the magic of this classic DOS game.
