# How to Find Your QuickBooks Desktop Pro 2016 License Key
 
If you have purchased QuickBooks Desktop Pro 2016, you may need to find your license key to install and activate the software on your computer. The license key is a 15-digit code that identifies your product and validates your purchase. Here are some ways to find your license key depending on how you bought QuickBooks Desktop Pro 2016:
 
- If you bought a digital version of QuickBooks Desktop Pro 2016 from the Intuit website, you can find your license key in the original purchase confirmation email. You can also sign in to your account management portal (CAMPS) and look for your product and license number there[^1^].
- If you bought a physical version of QuickBooks Desktop Pro 2016 from a retail store, you can find your license key on a label next to the UPC code on the original packaging[^1^]. If you have lost or damaged the packaging, you can use the License Look Up tool to retrieve your license key by entering your phone number or email address[^1^].
- If you have already installed QuickBooks Desktop Pro 2016 on your computer, you can find your license key by opening the software and pressing the F2 key. This will open the Product Information window where you can see your product name, product number, and license number. You can also see your release at the end of the product name[^1^].

Once you have your license key, you can enter it during the installation process or after launching QuickBooks Desktop Pro 2016 for the first time. You will also need to enter your product number, which is a 12-digit code that identifies your QuickBooks version and edition[^1^].
