Who is Mario Guerra, the author of Los Claroscuros Del Amor? He is a well-known psychologist, coach, hypnotherapist and communicator who has dedicated his life to helping people improve their personal and professional relationships. He has a master's degree in thanatology and has been the president of the Spanish and International Society of Thanatology of Mexico. He is also a frequent collaborator of radio and TV programs, such as Martha Debayle's show on W Radio and DiÃ¡logos en confianza on Canal Once.
 
Mario Guerra was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1932. He was one of thirteen children of a painter and a housekeeper. He faced many difficulties and challenges in his childhood, such as the death of his father, the involvement of his brothers in criminal activities, and the poverty and discrimination that affected his community. However, he also had the support and encouragement of his mother, who instilled in him the value of education and hard work. He graduated from high school and enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin, where he studied pharmacy. He also joined LULAC, a Latino civil rights organization, and became an activist for social justice.
 
After serving in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War, he returned to his studies and earned a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. He then pursued a law degree at St. Mary's University in San Antonio and worked as a pharmacist and a lawyer. In 1968 he cofounded MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, with Pete Tijerina. This organization became one of the most influential legal advocates for Latino rights in the country. Obledo served as its first general counsel and then as its executive director until 1975.
 
In 1975 Obledo moved to California to become the secretary of health and welfare under Governor Jerry Brown. He was the highest-ranking Hispanic state official at that time and oversaw a budget of $10 billion. He also created the Office of Multicultural Health to address the health disparities among different ethnic groups. He resigned from his post in 1982 after a controversy over his remarks about Proposition 13, a tax-cutting initiative that he opposed.
 
Obledo continued his involvement in Latino politics and civil rights after leaving public office. He founded several organizations, such as the National Coalition of Hispanic Organizations (COHO), the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA), and the California Coalition for Immigration Reform (CCIR). He also ran for governor of California in 1994 but lost in the Democratic primary. He received numerous awards and honors for his achievements, such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1998.
 
Mario Guerra Obledo died on August 18, 2010, at his home in Sacramento, California. He was 78 years old. He is survived by his wife Keda Alcala-Obledo, six children, thirteen grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. He is remembered as one of the most influential Latino leaders in U.S. history and as a champion of human rights for all people.
