## Step 1: Download and Install Orange 5 Software
 
You can download the latest Orange 5 software v1.35 from the official website[^1^] or from this link[^3^]. The software includes the driver, the O5Tool utility, the CnCTerm terminal program and the license files. To install the software, follow these steps:
 
- Extract the downloaded zip file to a folder on your computer.
- Connect the Orange 5 programmer with your computer via USB cable.
- Go to Device Manager->Other Devices->Orange5 USB, right click to Update Driver Software.
- Search automatically for updated driver software.
- Save driver software to C://Orange5\_1.35/Driver and press Next.
- Choose Install this driver software anyway.
- Insert the USB dongle that comes with the programmer into your computer.

## Step 2: Connect EEPROM to Orange 5 Programmer
 
Orange 5 programmer has a universal ZIF16 socket that can be used to connect various types of EEPROMs. You need to make sure that the pinout of the EEPROM matches the pinout of the socket. You can find the pinout diagrams of different EEPROMs in the software folder C://Orange5\_1.35/EEPROM or on the internet. For example, if you want to connect a 24C02 EEPROM, you need to align its pin 1 (A0) with pin 15 of the socket, its pin 2 (A1) with pin 14 of the socket, and so on. You can also use adapters or wires to connect EEPROMs that have different packages or pinouts.

## Step 3: Read and Write EEPROM with Orange 5 Software
 
To read and write EEPROM with Orange 5 software, follow these steps:

- Run the Orange5.exe program from C://Orange5\_1.35 folder.
- Select Options->Interface->USB from the menu bar.
- Select Options->Hardware Test to check if the programmer is connected properly.
- Select File->Open Device from the menu bar and choose the type of EEPROM you want to work with. For example, if you want to work with a 24C02 EEPROM, choose I2C->24Cxx->24C02.
- Select Device->Read All to read the data from the EEPROM and display it in the hex editor window.
- You can edit the data in the hex editor window as you wish. You can also save the data as a file or load a file into the hex editor window.
- Select Device->Write All to write the data from the hex editor window to the EEPROM.
- Select Device->Verify All to verify if the data in the EEPROM matches the data in the hex editor window.
