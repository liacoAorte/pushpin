# Perspective Rectifier: A Software for Surveying from Photos
 
Perspective Rectifier is a software that allows you to rectify pictures to do a survey from digital or traditional photos. It is useful for architectural, archaeological, and engineering surveys, as well as for hobbyists and enthusiasts of photography and history.

With Perspective Rectifier, you can perform geometric or points rectification, which means that you can correct the perspective distortion and scale the photo according to the real dimensions of the object. You can also create a mosaic of two or more images to cover a larger area. Moreover, you can perform measures of distance, perimeter, and area directly on the rectified images.
 
Perspective Rectifier works with any digital camera or scanner. You can import images of various formats, such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, PDF, etc. You can also export rectified images in common formats or in DXF format compatible with AutoCAD. Additionally, you can import and export World File and GeoTiff files for georeferencing purposes.
 
To use Perspective Rectifier, you need to define the vanishing lines and specify two measures for geometric rectification, or use four or more reference points for points rectification. You can also import reference points from topographical instruments or insert them manually. The software will then automatically rectify and scale the photo according to your parameters.
 
Perspective Rectifier is not only for architecture, but for any situation where you need to survey and measure planar surfaces from photos. It is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that will help you save time and money in your projects.
 
If you want to try Perspective Rectifier, you can download a free trial version from [RectifierSoft.com](http://rectifiersoft.com/index.htm). To activate the full version, you need to purchase a license code from the same website. The license code is called Codice Attivazioneiso and it will be sent to your email after payment.

In this article, we will show you some examples of how Perspective Rectifier can be used for different purposes. We will also give you some tips and tricks to get the best results from the software.
 
## Example 1: Architectural Survey
 
One of the most common applications of Perspective Rectifier is to survey buildings and monuments from photos. This can be useful for historical documentation, restoration, renovation, or design projects. For example, let's say you want to survey the facade of a church from a photo. Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Take a photo of the church from a suitable distance and angle. Try to avoid obstructions and shadows. Use a tripod if possible to avoid camera shake.
2. Import the photo into Perspective Rectifier. You can drag and drop the file or use the File menu.
3. Select Geometric Rectification from the Tools menu. A window will open where you can define the vanishing lines and measures.
4. Draw two horizontal vanishing lines along the edges of the roof and the base of the church. Draw two vertical vanishing lines along the edges of the tower and the side wall. Make sure the lines intersect at the vanishing points.
5. Specify two measures on the photo. For example, you can measure the height of the tower and the width of the facade. You need to know these values in real life or estimate them from other sources.
6. Click OK to rectify and scale the photo. The software will show you a preview of the result. You can adjust the parameters if needed.
7. Save or export the rectified image in your preferred format and resolution. You can also print it or copy it to the clipboard.

Now you have a rectified image of the church that you can use as a background in your CAD software. You can draw over it, take measurements, add annotations, etc.

## Example 2: Archaeological Survey
 
Perspective Rectifier can also be used to survey archaeological sites and artifacts from photos. This can be useful for documentation, analysis, or reconstruction purposes. For example, let's say you want to survey a mosaic floor from a photo. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Take a photo of the mosaic floor from a suitable distance and angle. Try to avoid reflections and distortions. Use a grid or a scale if possible to help with calibration.
2. Import the photo into Perspective Rectifier. You can drag and drop the file or use the File menu.
3. Select Points Rectification from the Tools menu. A window will open where you can define the reference points and plane.
4. Select four or more reference points on the photo that correspond to known points on the floor. You can use corners, intersections, or features of the mosaic as reference points. You need to know their coordinates in real life or estimate them from other sources.
5. Click OK to rectify and scale the photo. The software will automatically evaluate the plane equation and show you a preview of the result. You can adjust the parameters if needed.
6. Save or export the rectified image in your preferred format and resolution. You can also print it or copy it to clipboard.

Now you have a rectified image of the mosaic floor that you can use for further analysis or reconstruction. You can compare it with other mosaics, identify patterns, colors, motifs, etc.
 
## Tips and Tricks
 
Here are some tips and tricks to get the best results from Perspective Rectifier:

- Use high-quality photos with good resolution, contrast, and lighting.
- Avoid photos with too much distortion, blur, noise, or artifacts.
- Choose photos with clear and distinct features that can be used as reference points or vanishing lines.
- Use multiple photos from different angles and positions to cover a larger area or obtain more information.
- Use mosaic option to combine two or more images in a single rectification.
- Use measures option to perform measurements directly on the rectified images.
- Use zoom and pan tools to inspect details on the images.
- Use undo and redo 8cf37b1e13
