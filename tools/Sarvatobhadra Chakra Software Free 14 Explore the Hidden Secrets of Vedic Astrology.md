## What is Sarvatobhadra Chakra?
 
Sarvatobhadra Chakra is a square grid of 28 cells, each containing a letter of the Sanskrit alphabet. The letters represent the 27 Nakshatras and one Abhijit Nakshatra. The center of the grid is called the Brahma Bindu, which represents the supreme consciousness. The four corners of the grid are called the Digpalas, which represent the four directions and their deities. The grid also has four diagonal lines called Vedhas, which indicate afflictions or obstacles.
