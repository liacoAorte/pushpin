Blackadder 3D is a fan-made project that aims to recreate the classic British comedy series Blackadder in 3D animation. The project is led by animator and Blackadder fan David M. Jones, who has been working on it since 2017. The project has received support from some of the original cast members, such as Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, and Stephen Fry.
 
One of the episodes that Jones has been working on is House Sitting, which is based on the second episode of the second series, Head. In this episode, Blackadder is appointed as the Lord High Executioner and has to deal with a list of nobles who are scheduled to be beheaded. However, he accidentally kills one of them ahead of time and has to find a replacement. Meanwhile, he also has to look after the palace while Queen Elizabeth I is away.

Jones has shared some screenshots and clips of his work on his website and social media accounts. He has also launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the project and to hire more animators and voice actors. He hopes to finish the episode by the end of 2023 and release it online for free.
 
Blackadder 3D: House Sitting is a tribute to the original show and its creators, who have inspired generations of comedy fans and writers. Jones hopes that his project will also introduce new audiences to the witty and hilarious world of Blackadder.
  
Blackadder is a historical sitcom that ran for four series and several specials from 1983 to 1989. It was created by Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson, who also starred as the main character, Edmund Blackadder. Each series followed a different incarnation of Blackadder in a different period of British history, from the Middle Ages to World War I. The show was known for its sharp dialogue, dark humor, and historical parodies.
 
The second series, which House Sitting is based on, was set in the Elizabethan era and featured Miranda Richardson as Queen Elizabeth I, Stephen Fry as Lord Melchett, Tim McInnerny as Lord Percy, and Tony Robinson as Baldrick, Blackadder's loyal but dim-witted servant. The series was praised for its clever writing and performances, and is widely regarded as one of the best British comedies of all time.

Blackadder 3D: House Sitting is not the first attempt to revive the show in a different format. In 1999, there was a live stage show called Blackadder: Back & Forth, which featured the original cast and was shown at the Millennium Dome. In 2012, there was a radio sketch called The King's Speech, which parodied the film of the same name and had Atkinson as King George VI and Fry as his speech therapist. In 2016, there was a comic relief sketch called Blackadder: The Whole Rotten Saga, which summarized the entire series in three minutes.
  
Blackadder 3D: House Sitting is not the only episode that Jones has been working on. He has also been adapting some of the other episodes from the second series, such as Bells, Beer, and Chains. He plans to make a total of six episodes, one for each series of the original show. He has also been creating some original characters and scenarios that fit in the Blackadder universe.
 
Jones says that he is a huge fan of Blackadder and that he wants to honor the legacy of the show and its creators. He says that he has been careful to respect the original scripts and jokes, but also to add some new elements and twists that make the episodes more suitable for 3D animation. He says that he hopes that his project will make the fans happy and that it will also attract new viewers who may not be familiar with the show.
 
Blackadder 3D: House Sitting is expected to be released in late 2023 on Jones's website and YouTube channel. Jones says that he is grateful for all the support and feedback that he has received from the fans and the cast members. He says that he is looking forward to sharing his work with the world and that he hopes that it will make people laugh and smile.
