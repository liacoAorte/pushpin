## Layering System
 
Mari's layering system allows you to build up your look with a combination of paint, procedurals, filters, color correction, and masks. You can work with up to 32K textures and multiple UV tiles per object, and blend them with different blending modes and opacity settings. You can also use procedural layers to generate noises, patterns, projections, and more, and adjust their parameters in real-time.
 
## Interactive Preview
 
Mari's interactive preview lets you see how your painting looks in different lighting and shading conditions. You can cast shadows from multiple light sources, use environment lighting, and apply specular highlights and displacement maps. You can also preview your painting with built-in support for Unreal, Arnold, V-Ray, and Redshift shaders, or import your own custom shaders.
 
## Geometry Handling
 
Mari can handle animated geometry and textures with ease, allowing you to isolate, select, mask, and hide geometry per patch or face. You can also use overlapping UVs to reuse the same texture across different models or parts of the model. Additionally, you can import multiple camera moves to view your model from different angles.
 
## Color Management
 
Mari supports OpenColorIO (OCIO), the open source color management solution from Sony Picture Imageworks. This means you can handle color transforms and image display across multiple applications by setting up a single profile that provides consistent colors. OCIO is suitable for both visual effects and animated features, and is compatible with industry standards like ACES.
 
## Baking Engine
 
Mari integrates with Modo's baking engine, which allows you to bake textures right from within Mari. You can bake normal maps from bump maps, ambient occlusion maps from geometry, or any other texture map you need. The baked texture is automatically applied to the mesh in Mari, saving you time and hassle.
 
## Pipeline Integration
 
Mari fits seamlessly into any pipeline, thanks to its support for open standards and formats like OpenSubdiv, FBX, Alembic, PSD, EXR, and more. You can also use Mari's extensive APIs and Python scripting to customize and automate your workflow. Whether you are working on games, films, TV shows, or commercials, Mari can adapt to your needs.
